# All Sorting Algorithms
  In this repo one can find all the sorting techniques listed in the decreasing order of worst case time complexity.

## Types of Sorting
  **Selection Sort**\
  **Bubble Sort**\
  **Insertion Sort**\
  **Merge Sort**\
  **Quick Sort**\
  **Heap Sort**\
  **Counting Sort**\
  **Shell Sort**\
  **Radix Sort**\
  **Bucket Sort**

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity
Sorting Algorithm	Time Complexity - Best	Time Complexity - Worst	Time Complexity - Average	Space Complexity
Bubble Sort	n	n2	n2	1
Selection Sort	n2	n2	n2	1
Insertion Sort	n	n2	n2	1
Merge Sort	nlog n	nlog n	nlog n	n
Quicksort	nlog n	n2	nlog n	log n
Counting Sort	n+k	n+k	n+k	max
Radix Sort	n+k	n+k	n+k	max
Bucket Sort	n+k	n2	n	n+k
Heap Sort	nlog n	nlog n	nlog n	1
Shell Sort	nlog n	n2	nlog
